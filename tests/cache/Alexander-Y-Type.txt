The '''Alexander Y Type''' was a long-running design of [[single-decker bus]] and [[single-decker bus|single-decker]] [[coach (bus)|intercity bus]] [[coachwork|bodywork]] built by [[Walter Alexander Coachbuilders]] in [[Falkirk]], [[Scotland]]. It was built on a wide range of chassis between 1962 and 1983. A small number were built at [[Walter Alexander Coachbuilders|Alexander]]'s [[Belfast]] subsidiary.

From 1971 it became the '''AY Type''' (with the A signifying alloy construction) or '''AYS Type''' (with the S signifying service bus specification), although in common usage all are referred to simply as Y Type.

==Chassis==
The majority of Y Type bodies were fitted to [[Leyland Leopard]] chassis, and most were built for the [[Scottish Bus Group]] and its predecessors.

==Other customers==
As can be seen from the table above, SBG was by far the biggest customer, buying over 86% of the total output of Y Types. However other customers also existed, amongst these being the [[North Western Road Car Company (1923)|North Western Road Car Company]] with 65 Leopards and 30 Bristol REs, Venture of Consett with 32 Leopards and 12 Reliances, Lancaster City Council with 26 Leopards, and [[First Potteries|Potteries Motor Traction]] with 25 Reliances.
