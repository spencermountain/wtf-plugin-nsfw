'''Antique''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Greece|Greek]] singing duo consisting of [[Elena Paparizou]] (Έλενα Παπαρίζου in [[Greek language|Greek)]] and [[Nikos Panagiotidis]] (Νίκος Παναγιωτίδης in [[Greek language|Greek)]] originating from [[Sweden]] which combined Greek popular music and lyrics with a Nordic dance pop beat. Both Paparizou and Panagiotidis were born and raised in [[Sweden]] by Greek parents. They were the first ever to be nominated for a [[Grammis|Swedish Grammis]] in the category modern dance with a Greek song. In 2001, Antique were selected to represent Greece at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[Copenhagen]] with the song "[[Die for You (Antique song)|Die for You]]", sung in a blend of English and Greek, ending with a third place &ndash; only behind [[Estonia]] and hosts [[Denmark]].

=== Eurovision Song Contest 2001 ===

Despite being relatively unknown in Greece, the duo entered the [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001|national final]] to be Greece's representatives in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] with the song "[[Die For You (Antique song)|(I Would) Die for You]]", written by Nikos Terzis with lyrics by Antonis Pappas, placing joint first, but being named the winners by default as they had won the public vote.<ref name="espresso_news"/> The song placed third in the actual contest with 147 points; although equaled by the 2004 entry, it was the best placing Greece had ever received until Paparizou won the contest as a solo artist in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The song went on to become their biggest hit in Greece, reaching Platinum status, while it peaked at number three in Sweden, and charted elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Antique's success in the contest led to them earning recognition in Greece and working there for the rest of their career. 

In continuation, they recorded four studio albums that achieved mild success, performed a small European tour, and collaborated with artists such as [[Katy Garbi]] and [[Slavi Trifonov]]. In 2002, they recorded the song "V-Power" in both English and [[Greek language|Greek]] versions. The songs were included on the 14-track promotional album released for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] by [[V2 Records]] to promote the premium unleaded gasoline product known as ''[[Shell V-Power|V-Power]]''. Antique disbanded in late 2003 on good terms with both members pursuing solo careers. Elena Paparizou won the [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005|Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] representing Greece with "[[My Number One]]". There are currently no intentions of reuniting the group, although they have both expressed to want to reunite in the future.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sizzling Elena Paparizou plans hot new album |url=http://www.lgr.co.uk/news/entertainment/12438/sizzling-elena-paparizou-plans-hot-new-album/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412132927/http://www.lgr.co.uk/news/entertainment/12438/sizzling-elena-paparizou-plans-hot-new-album/ |archivedate=2008-04-12 }} ''London Greek Radio''.
