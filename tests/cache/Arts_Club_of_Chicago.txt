'''Arts Club of Chicago''' is a private club located in the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois]], United States, a block east of the [[Magnificent Mile]], that exhibits international [[contemporary art]].  It was founded in 1916, inspired by the success of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]'s handling of the [[Armory Show]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/70.html|author=Kruty, Paul|title=Armory Show of 1913|accessdate=June 27, 2007|year=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago}}</ref>  Its founding was viewed as a statement that art had become an important component of civilized urban life.<ref name=EOCArt>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/72.html|author=Warren, Lynne|title=Art|accessdate=June 27, 2007|year=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago}}</ref> The Arts Club is said to have been pro-[[Modernism|Modernist]] from its founding.<ref name=EOCAEC>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/83.html|author=Roeder George H., Jr.|title=Artists, Education and Culture of|accessdate=June 27, 2007|year=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago}}</ref> The Club strove to break new ground with its shows, rather than collect the works of established artists as the Art Institute does.

The club presented [[Pablo Picasso]]'s first United States showing.<ref name=MM/> In addition, the 1951 exhibition by [[Jean Dubuffet]] and his "Anticultural Positions" lecture at the Arts Club were tremendous influences on what would become the mid-1960s [[Imagist]] movement.<ref name=EOCArt/> Another important presentation in the history of the Arts Club was the [[Fernand Léger]] showing of ''Le Ballet Mecanique''.<ref name=EOCAEC/>

The Club's move in 1997 to its current location at 201 E. Ontario Street was not without controversy because the club demolished its former interior space designed by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and moved only the central staircase to the new gallery space.<ref name=AIACO>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiachicago.org/special_features/1996_Design_Awards/Unbuilt/Awards/Winners/unbuilt_171.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011124011911/http://www.aiachicago.org/special_features/1996_Design_Awards/Unbuilt/Awards/Winners/unbuilt_171.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 24, 2001 |title=Honor : The Arts Club of Chicago |accessdate=June 28, 2007 |publisher=American Institute of Architects Chicago }}</ref> However, the new space is {{convert|19000|sqft|m2}}, which is {{convert|7000|sqft|m2}} larger than the old space.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet>{{cite web|url=http://www.artn.com/Building.pdf|title=The Arts Club of Chicago Building Fact Sheet|accessdate=June 29, 2007|date=|publisher=www.artn.com|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615211113/http://www.artn.com/Building.pdf |archivedate = June 15, 2006}}</ref>

==Mission and purpose==
The inaugural mission of the club was "to encourage higher standards of art, maintain galleries for that purpose, and to promote the mutual acquaintance of art lovers and art workers."<ref name=ACoCFactSheet/>  This mission arose from the contemporary Chicago active art scene, which had 30 commercial [[art gallery|art galleries]] showing traditional art and an internationally recognized museum.  Additionally, the local [[mass media]] gave equitable coverage to the [[visual art]]s.  The art scene also had enough clubs and organizations for musicians, writers and [[artist]]s.  Unfortunately, the lively art scene did not adequately represent the [[avant-garde]] art.  The local galleries emphasized American, English and the occasional French work, emphasizing prints and drawings.  This necessitated trips to New York City, London or Paris for Chicagoans who wanted to buy art.<ref name=ACoC75p6>Wells, p. 6</ref>

The club does not generally show traveling exhibitions curated by others.  Instead, it curates its own exhibits, often with very original works.  This places emphasis on cutting edge and avant-garde art.

==History==
[[File:20070711 Mies van der Rohe Staircase.JPG|left|thumb|[[Mies van der Rohe]] staircase and [[Alexander Calder]] mobile]]
The club was founded in 1916 and experienced its first coverage in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on March 16, 1916.<ref>Wells, p. 6.</ref>  It had office space in the [[Fine Arts Building (Chicago)|Fine Arts Building]] that became too limiting to serve the club's mission.  In 1918, the club elected Rue Winterbotham Carpenter to replace Mrs. Robert McGann as president.  She moved the club to 610 South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] .<ref>Wells, p. 7.</ref>  The first exhibition included portraits by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], [[Renoir]], [[Mary Cassatt|Cassatt]], [[August Johns]] and others.  By 1922, the club had outgrown its quarters and sponsored supplementary space at the Art Institute of Chicago until 1927 when the cost of doing so became prohibitive.  In 1924, the club moved to the north tower of the [[Wrigley Building]].<ref>Wells, p. 8.</ref>  Among its first exhibitions at the Wrigley building was the first major United States show (seventeen sculptures, nineteen drawings and a painting) of Brâncuși.  The show was installed by [[Marcel Duchamp]].<ref name="Wells, p. 9">Wells, p. 9.</ref>  Rue Carpenter died on December 7, 1931,<ref name="Wells, p. 9"/> and Mrs. Charles Goodspeed was elected president in 1932.<ref>Wells, p. 10.</ref>  The club moved to more spacious accommodations at the Wrigley Building in 1936.  "Bobsy" Goodspeed served as president until 1940.  Then, Rue Winterbotham Carpenter's niece Rue Winterbotham Shaw was elected President.<ref>Wells, p. 11.</ref> In 1947, the club scaled down its operations for four years after losing its Wrigley Building [[lease]].  In 1951, it moved to 109 East Ontario in quarters built to specification that were designed by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref>Wells, p. 39.</ref>  Using Arts Club furniture, he designed a gallery, dining room, and lecture hall in a pre-existing building.  The gallery was built around [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s ''[[The Golden Bird (Brâncuși sculpture)|The Golden Bird]]'' and the stairway was renowned for its simple elegance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chicago Architecture and Design|author1=Pridmore, Jay  |author2=George A. Larson |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=0-8109-5892-9|chapter=The Meaning of Mies and the Rise of Modernism}}</ref>  Shaw died in January 1979 and James Phinney Baxter was elected to serve until 1981 when Stanley Freehling was elected.<ref>Wells, p. 72.</ref>  The club struggled financially in the 1980s.<ref>Wells,  p. 73.</ref>

===1990s - new building===
In the 1990s, the club was located west of Michigan Avenue and behind the 620 building which was home to many of Chicago's finest [[art dealer]]s including Richard Gray and Richard L. Feigen & Co. The Arts club did not own the land upon which their famous Mies clubhouse was built; instead, the club held the land in a longterm [[lease]]hold. In 1990, the owner of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to sell. At first the Arts Club hoped to raise the money to purchase its land along with the 620 N. Michigan Avenue property in an effort spearheaded by Richard Gray, but it quickly became apparent that the club would lose a bidding war over this valuable land. A developer bought the property and demolished the entire block to make way for a movie complex and [[shopping center]].

With the prospect of losing its home, the Arts Club opted to sell one of the most valuable items in its collection to finance the purchase of new land. The club decided to sell Brâncuși's Bird to the Art Institute of Chicago.<ref>Shaw, p. 29.</ref> To finance the purchase, the Art Institute sold several second tier works from its famous [[Impressionist]] collection at [[Sotheby's]] in guaranteed lots which was a new concept in the [[auction]] world in 1990. While without permanent home, the club continued to meet regularly in space loaned by the Casino, another famous [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] club.

The {{convert|19000|sqft|m2}} John Vinci designed building is a two-story structure that cost [[United States Dollar|$]]9 million for the land, building, [[landscaping]], and [[interior design]]. The exterior [[facade]] is buff [[brick]] with black [[granite]] windowsills and [[thresholds]] and white-painted [[steel]] windows.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/> The building features furniture dating back to the club's founding as well as Mies van der Rohe designs.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/>  Several elements of the new building's design are considered homages to Mies. The fact that the building was so Miesian thirty years after his death while the club focused on avant-gard art was a bit of a controversy.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chicago Architecture and Design|author1=Pridmore, Jay  |author2=George A. Larson |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=0-8109-5892-9|chapter=Chicago's Second Modern Period}}</ref> The building's [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] that allows filtered light into the central [[art gallery|galleries]] and dining areas is its primary feature.<ref name=AIACO/>  Another focal point of the building is the restored Mies van der Rohe steel staircase that provides access to the second floor.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/> The design includes white-painted steel, travertine [[marble]], floor-to-ceiling curtains, dark-stained wood floors, and large areas of glass.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/> The color palette of saffron, black, gray, scarlet, and white is consistent with the former building.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/> Also notable are the veil of north side metal screens.<ref name=AIACO/> The building also has a {{convert|1600|sqft|m2}} outdoor landscaped garden.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/> The building accommodates a 200-person audience seating.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/>

==Collection==
The Arts Club's [[Collection (museum)|collection]] is a combination of acquisitions from its exhibitions and donations from both members and artists.  It includes works by [[Georges Braque]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Francis Picabia]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].  The club has made recent acquisitions of contemporary works by [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Alex Katz]], and [[Peter Doig]].<ref name=ACoCFactSheet/> The Club maintains a document collection, mostly of correspondence with its artists, at the [[Newberry Library]].<ref name=AIACO/>  Further information on the club collection can be found in ''The Arts Club of Chicago: The Collection 1916-1996'' by Sophia Shaw, granddaughter of the Club's dynamic past president Rue Winterbotham Shaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/13456.ctl |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |title=Shaw, Sophia, editor The Arts Club of Chicago: The Collection 1916-1996 |accessdate=August 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918054331/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/13456.ctl |archivedate=September 18, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Exhibitions, performances and lectures==
Until the [[Museum of Modern Art]] was founded in 1929, Chicago and The Arts Club in particular was the most receptive exhibitor of [[modern art]] in the United States.  At that time, no institution in the United States, especially none in Manhattan, would exhibit European [[modernism]].  By renting space at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]'s [[Art Institute of Chicago Building|Building]] the Arts Club was able to arrange showings in Chicago's most prestigious museum.<ref name=MM/>

The club has exhibited an impressive number of well-known 20th century [[visual artist]]s.  Many of the century's most controversial artists made their United States or [[midwest]] solo exhibition debuts at the club including: Alexander Calder, [[Marc Chagall]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]]. In addition, many artists have given lectures at the Club, including [[Martha Graham]], [[Kathleen Battle]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[Robert Altman]]. Aside from visual artists, the Club also has hosted lectures and performances from such prominent musicians as [[John Cage]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Ramsey Lewis]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], and poets [[W. H. Auden]], [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[William Butler Yeats]].<ref name=ACoCFactSheet/>  Most notable among these exhibitions was Picasso's first United States solo exhibition,<ref name=MM>Fitzgerald, pp. 120-1</ref> ''Original Drawings by Pablo Picasso'' from March 20 to April 22, 1923,<ref>Shaw, pg. 123</ref> by the Arts Club at its installation at the Art Institute of Chicago. (Picasso's work had first been shown the US in a group show in New York curated by [[Edward Steichen]] in 1911.<ref name="MM-278">Fitzgerald, pp. 278</ref>)  In the 1930s, when [[Isamu Noguchi]] was still known as a sculptor, they hosted him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744590,00.html|title=Third Noguchi|accessdate=April 30, 2008|date=October 10, 1932|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>  In 1970 when [[Varujan Boghosian]] was a timely sculptor known for depicting the legend of [[orpheus]],  The Arts Club hosted a showing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876579,00.html|title=The Mythmaker|accessdate=April 30, 2008|date=February 9, 1970|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>

==Locations==
The current location is the club's seventh location.  However, this is the first building owned by the club.  The location history is listed below.<ref name=ACoCFactSheet>{{cite web|url=http://www.artn.com/ArtsClub.pdf|title=Fact Sheet|accessdate=June 29, 2007|date=|publisher=www.artn.com|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615211001/http://www.artn.com/ArtsClub.pdf |archivedate = June 15, 2006}}</ref>

The first home at the [[Fine Arts Building (Chicago)|Fine Arts Building]] had no exhibition space.  The club was not able to put on its first exhibition until December 18 when it moved to a location with exhibition space. The club's early gallery spaces were not sufficient to achieve the club's goals and it agreed to assume cost and selection responsibilities for [[Visual arts|works]] in a series of shows at The Arts Club Exhibition Room at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1922-1927.<ref name=ACoC75p8>Wells, p. 8</ref>
