'''Rocco Siffredi''' (born '''Rocco Antonio Tano'''; 4 May 1964) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Pornographic film actor|pornographic actor]], director and producer of [[pornographic movies]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ilgazzettino.it/articolo.php?id=84759&sez=PERSONE|newspaper=Il Gazzettino|title=Rocco Siffredi, grande ritorno al porno: "Mi mancava troppo il sesso"|date=18 December 2009|language=Italian|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://terranoticias.terra.es/cultura/articulo/siffredi_rey_porno_publica_secretos_1127881.htm|title=El 'rey del porno' Siffredi publica los secretos de su vida|date=6 October 2006|work=Terra España|language=Spanish|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref>

He took his [[stage name]] from the character Roch Siffredi played by [[Alain Delon]] in the French gangster film ''[[Borsalino (film)|Borsalino]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lematin.ch/loisirs/tv-dvd/duo-delon-belmondo-ressuscite-eclat-193451|title=Le duo Delon-Belmondo ressuscite avec éclat|website=lematin.ch|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Known as the "Italian Stallion", Siffredi has starred in more than 1,300 pornographic films.<ref name=IAFD/>

== Pornography career ==
[[File:Rocco Siffredi and Rocco Tanica - Lucca Comics & Games 2016 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Siffredi with Rocco Tanica in 2016]]
Siffredi met porn actor Leonardo Codazzo in a French sex club in 1985 and was introduced to producer Marco and director Michela, who cast him in his first pornographic role, ''Attention fillettes...'' (''Watch Out, Little Girls...'') in 1987, in which he performed [[anal sex]]. Siffredi then stepped away from porn and worked as a fashion model, but returned to the business after two years with the help of porn actress [[Teresa Orlowski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roccosiffrediblog.com/2008/05/rocco-siffredi.html|title=Roccosiffrediblog.com|publisher=Roccosiffrediblog.com|date=May 2008|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> Siffredi went on to perform in both plot-based and [[Gonzo pornography|gonzo-style pornography]], with styles of sex ranging from ordinary to extreme. However, it was Siffredi's performances involving anal sex and [[anilingus]], as well as rough sex and his psychological intensity and athleticism, which earned him recognition and ultimately a cult following. Through collaboration with [[John Stagliano]]'s [[Evil Angel (studio)|Evil Angel]] studio and then his own [[Budapest]]-based Rocco Siffredi Produzioni as both a performer and director, Siffredi became one of the most powerful and recognizable personalities in pornography. "Rocco has far more power in this industry than any actress," Stagliano commented in 2001. Siffredi has credited Stagliano with being his mentor through all 30 years of his career.<ref name="xbiz">{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/193278 |title=Rocco Siffredi Confirms Retirement from Performing |author=Dan Miller |date=9 April 2016}}</ref>

== Retirement ==
In June 2004, Siffredi declared that he would retire from performing in porn for the sake of his children, and instead focus on direction and production. "My children are growing up," he said, "and I can no longer just say 'Dad is going to work to make money for the family.' They want to know more."<ref>{{cite web|author=Sasha|url=http://planetsex.blogspot.com/2005/07/roko-porn-king-retires-after-1300.html|title=Sex - Dark Side of the Moon: Roko "The Porn King" Retires after 1300 Movies|publisher=Planetsex.blogspot.com|date=29 July 2005|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref> Regarding Siffredi's long career, [[Axel Braun]] commented, "The problem is that he's been trying for years to find an 'heir to the throne', but it's no easy task. He thought he found him in [[Nacho Vidal]], but then Nacho went his own way".<ref>''[[Adult Video News]]'', 2004.</ref> Siffredi, while continuing to direct, was largely absent as an on-screen performer for nearly five years. However, [[sexual frustration]] and disappointment as a director with his male talent and the state of the porn industry overall led Siffredi to return as a performer in 2009.<ref name="business.avn.com"/> Despite renewed success, Siffredi announced his retirement once again in 2015, shortly after appearing on the Italian [[reality television]] show ''[[L'Isola dei Famosi]]'' (''Celebrity Island'') which saw him stranded naked and alone on a beach for one week. He was reported to have told a friend, "I never felt so naked as I did then. I was all alone and it gave me a lot of time to think about what is important. And I realised I don't want to lose my wife."<ref name="mirror">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/rocco-siffredi-porn-star-quits-5373564|title=Rocco Siffredi: Porn star quits XXX movies out of love for his wife|author=John Shammas|date=20 March 2015}}</ref> He later told the press, "[M]ore than a year ago I started to get uncomfortable in the front of the camera...Something inside of me has changed."<ref name="xbiz"/> However, he has continued performing sex in titles such as ''Rocco One on One'' and ''Rocco's Intimate Castings.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=rsiffredi/gender=m/rocco-siffredi.htm|work=[[Internet Adult Film Database]]|title=Rocco Siffredi|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref>

== Style of pornography ==
Actress [[Bobbi Starr]] noted of Siffredi, "Any girl in the industry who has been with him... will tell you that they have done things with him that they [would] never do with anyone else."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotpie.com.au/Article/RHP-Exclusive-Interview-with-Porn-Queen-Bobbi-Starr-512|title=RHP Exclusive Interview with Porn Queen Bobbi Starr|publisher=RedHotPie|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref>

Speaking of his female partners, Siffredi says, "I want to see emotion... fear... excitement... the eyes going up from being surprised."<ref name="business.avn.com">{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/Rocco-Siffredi-Reveals-Reasons-for-Return-In-Exclusive-Interview-384795.html|title=AVN - Rocco Siffredi Reveals Reasons for Return In Exclusive Interview|publisher=Business.avn.com|date=19 February 2010|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref>

== In mainstream media ==
Siffredi is one of a few porn actors to enjoy crossover appeal and success with respect to other segments of the adult film industry, as well as some in mainstream media.

In [[1999 in film|1999]], he appeared in the controversial [[Catherine Breillat]] film ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]''. His performance in this role was followed by a part specifically written for him by the same director in her [[2003 in film|2003]] film ''[[Anatomie de L'enfer]]'' (''Anatomy of Hell''), in which he played a gay man who became sexually involved with a woman. Both films featured unsimulated sexual scenes involving Siffredi, although it is disputed whether he actually had intercourse with co-star [[Caroline Ducey]] in ''Romance'' (she said no, Siffredi said yes).<ref name=Times>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article457870.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2|title=Culture: Is it art or porn?|accessdate=24 September 2009|date=18 July 2004|publisher=[[timesonline.co.uk]]}}</ref> In 2012, he made a cameo as himself in the successful French comedy ''[[Porn in the Hood]]''.

Siffredi is also visible in non-pornographic roles on Italian television, including television commercials for Amica Chips, a snack food, which have spawned considerable controversy and have at one point been taken off the air,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloccato lo spot con Rocco Siffredi|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/03_Marzo/19/siffredi.shtml|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=[[Corriere della Sera]]|date=20 March 2006}}</ref> a [[Cielo (TV channel)|Cielo]] show, ''Ci pensa Rocco'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Ci pensa Rocco, "il prete del sesso"|url=http://www.vanityfair.it/show/tv/13/10/30/ci-pensa-rocco-sesso-siffredi-programma-cielo|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=24 October 2013}}</ref> and a [[La 5]] docu-reality series, ''Casa Siffredi''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Francesco Canino|title=Casa Siffredi: un reality racconta il lato inedito del porno star|url=http://www.panorama.it/televisione/casa-siffredi-reality-show-la5-rocco-siffredi-famiglia-anticipazioni/|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=[[Panorama (magazine)|Panorama]]|date=26 August 2015}}</ref>

In 1997, Italian band [[Elio e Le Storie Tese]] dedicated a song and a video, "Rocco e Le Storie Tese", to Siffredi. Siffredi himself directed the video, also appearing in it.<ref name=Deregibus>{{cite book|last=Enrico Deregibus|title=Dizionario completo della Canzone Italiana|publisher=Giunti Editore, 2010|isbn=8809756258}}</ref> Siffredi also duetted with the band in the song "Un bacio piccolissimo" at the [[Sanremo Music Festival 2013|63rd edition]] of the [[Sanremo Music Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sanremo giovani, vince Antonio Maggio.

== Personal life ==
Siffredi had a three-year relationship with the actress [[Louise Germaine]]. He is married to Rosa Caracciolo (born Rózsa Tassi), a Hungarian model whom he met in 1993 in Cannes and with whom he performed two years later in ''Tarzan X: Shame of Jane.'' Together they have two sons, Lorenzo and Leonardo.<ref name="Marriage">{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/magazine/2002/162/1036066267.html|title=Rocco es un hombre que disfruta muchísimo con su trabajo|publisher=elmundo.es|accessdate=27 January 2010|date=3 November 2002|author=Juan Carlos Rodríguez|language=Spanish}}</ref> During his initial retirement starting in 2004, Siffredi battled sex addiction and disappeared from home for days to have sex; including with [[prostitutes]], older women, [[transgender women]], and men.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stern |first1=Marlow |title=Rocco Siffredi, Godfather of Rough Sex: ‘What You Call Violence, I Call Pain with Pleasure’ |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/rocco-siffredi-godfather-of-rough-sex-what-you-call-violence-i-call-pain-with-pleasure |accessdate=17 August 2018 |work=The Daily Beast |date=22 October 2016 |language=en}}</ref> Upon his decision to return to on-screen pornographic performance in 2009, Siffredi recounted, "I spoke with my wife and she said it's my problem only, it doesn't belong to her and the boys. And she said, 'You decided to stop; we never asked you. So if you want to go back, just go back".<ref name="business.avn.com"/> However, after a long period of intensive performing, with much time away from his home in Italy, Siffredi announced his retirement again in 2015 for the sake of his marriage. "Today I can see, my wife, she is the top priority", he said in a press statement. "She deserves to have what she wanted from day one, to be with only me without sharing with other girls".<ref name="xbiz"/> Caracciolo told the press, "I know him very well and I love him for who and what he is. Let's see what the new version of him will be like".<ref name="mirror"/>

Siffredi discussed his personal life on the reality television show ''L'Isola dei Famosi'' (''Celebrity Island''). Speaking of his sexuality, Siffredi discussed his [[sex addiction]] as emerging from "some kind of devil in me" and spoke of himself, "[It] sometimes sends me out of my mind". He discussed asking God for intervention from the spirit of his mother, whose photograph he always carries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagospia.com/rubrica-2/media_e_tv/diktat-spaak-ona-mancata-naufraga-avrebbe-preteso-che-suo-93752.htm|author=Alberto Dandolo|website=Dagospia|title=Rocco Siffredi|date=3 February 2015|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref>
