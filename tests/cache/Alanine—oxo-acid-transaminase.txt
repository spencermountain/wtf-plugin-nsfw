In [[enzymology]], an '''alanine-oxo-acid transaminase''' ({{EC number|2.6.1.12}}) is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]]

:L-alanine + a 2-oxo acid <math>\rightleftharpoons</math> pyruvate + an L-amino acid

Thus, the two [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] of this enzyme are [[L-alanine]] and [[2-oxo acid]], whereas its two [[product (chemistry)|products]] are [[pyruvate]] and [[L-amino acid]].

This enzyme belongs to the family of [[transferase]]s, specifically the [[transaminases]], which transfer nitrogenous groups.  The [[List of enzymes|systematic name]] of this enzyme class is '''L-alanine:2-oxo-acid aminotransferase'''. Other names in common use include '''L-alanine-alpha-keto acid aminotransferase''', '''leucine-alanine transaminase''', '''alanine-keto acid aminotransferase''', and '''alanine-oxo acid aminotransferase'''.  This enzyme participates in [[alanine and aspartate metabolism]].  It employs one [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], [[pyridoxal phosphate]].
