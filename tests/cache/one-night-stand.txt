A '''one-night stand''' is a single [[Human sexual activity|sexual encounter]] in which there is an expectation that there shall be no further relations between the sexual participants. The practice can be described as "sexual activity without emotional commitment or future involvement".<ref name="Turner">Jeffrey S. Turner, ''American Families in Crisis: A Reference Handbook'' (2009), p. 47.</ref>

== Further relations ==
Author Laura Bergman suggests that the circumstances that lead to such an encounter do not necessarily preclude a later relationship:
{{quote|Certainly, having sex on a first date can be a death knell if your partner decides that a one-night stand is all he is after. On the other hand, many happy couples broke that rule of no sex on the first date and have been together for years.<ref>Laura Berman, ''It's Not Him, It's You!: How to Take Charge of Your Life and Create the Love and Intimacy You Deserve'' (2010), p. 132.</ref>}}
In contrast to a one-night stand, when the individuals involved have recurrent sexual contact without [[Romance (love)|romantic involvement]], this is considered a [[casual sexual relationship]].<ref>[http://goodmenproject.com/sex-relationships/casual-sex-explained-and-defined/ Casual Sex, Explained (and Defined) — The Good Men Project Magazine].

It has been noted that the one-night stand is the most common form of [[infidelity]]<ref name="Turner"/> and is often used in research, polls and surveys to define the level of [[promiscuity]] in a society at any given time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liverpool named UK’s most promiscuous city in ‘one night stand’ poll|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/08/liverpool-named-uks-most-promiscuous-city-in-one-night-stand-poll-4254176/|website=Metro.co.uk|publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited}}</ref> It has also been suggested that such an act can be as threatening to a relationship as a long-term affair:

{{quote|A one-night stand can be more dangerous than finding a lover with mutual considerations. This scenario is good for the business traveler who has the odds in his or her favor; however, it is very important to know with whom you are getting into bed, even for just one night. No one should be exempt from causing you a problem, no matter the distance or circumstance. A one-night stand is still a form of infidelity and can be just as damaging for you and your partner if discovered.<ref>J. Frances, Joann Perrino, ''Designing Infidelity: A Reference Guide to the Art of Cheating to Perfection'' (2006), p. 4.</ref>}}

Some women have suggested that women who feel sexually insecure or unfulfilled should seek out one-night stands for personal growth and fulfillment. One writes, "[a] one-night stand is the erotic manifestation of carpe diem— only we are seizing the night instead of the day".<ref>Susan Cheever, "Sex With a Stranger", in [[Erica Jong]], ''Sugar in My Bowl: Real Women Write About Real Sex'' (2011), p. 35.</ref> Another source advises women seeking [[empowerment]] to "jumpstart your heyday by having a one-night stand",<ref name="Lipper">Jodi Lipper, Cerina Vincent, ''Live Like a Hot Chick: How to Feel Sexy, Find Confidence, and Create Balance at Work and Play'' (2010), p. 167.</ref> and clarifies that the one-night stand should be a conscious choice.<ref name="Lipper"/>

==Fantasy==

A one-night stand may also be included in a [[sexual fantasy]].<ref> [https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/fantasies-fulfilled-one-night-at-a-time-20140327-35kyo.html Fantasies fulfilled, one night at a time]</ref>
